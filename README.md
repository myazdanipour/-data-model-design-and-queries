# Digikala Data Management Evaluation and SQL Prototypehttps://github.com/myazdanipour/Data-Model-Design-and-Queries/tree/main

## ✔️Overview
This project critically evaluates the data management practices of Digikala, a leading online shopping platform, and proposes solutions to improve its operations. The project focuses on optimising data flow and enhancing inventory management by integrating an OLAP system for real-time analytics. A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) were created to represent the current and proposed systems. Additionally, a fully implemented SQL-based prototype was built, including 8 queries to generate strategic reports and insights.

## ✔️Main Report
The complete evaluation and analysis are available in the detailed report here: [Digikala Data Management Evaluation Report](link-to-your-report).

## ✔️Problem Statement
Digikala faces challenges in managing inventory during high-demand periods and promotional events. To address this, the project recommends implementing an OLAP system to forecast demand and adjust inventory levels dynamically. This will enable Digikala to:

- Monitor customer behaviour
- Improve inventory replenishment
- Optimise supply chain operations

## ✔️Key Components

### 1. Data Management Practices
The project evaluates various aspects of Digikala’s data management, such as:

- **Data Integration**: Consolidating customer, product, and sales data for streamlined processes.
- **Data Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless data exchange between the online shopping platform and the inventory system.
- **Data Flow Optimisation**: Implementing automated, real-time analytics to proactively manage inventory.

### 2. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- **Context Diagram (As Is)**: Shows how Digikala currently handles customer interactions, payment processing, and inventory management.
- **Level 0 DFD (As Is)**: Visualises the data flow for key processes like order fulfilment, payment processing, and inventory updates.
